How might we use IT to help Singapore to be a better place to stay?

1) Reducing the amount of people waiting for chairs in those food courts. - Solution: Make an app and place a sensor on the table. When there is no items detected on the tables, the app automatically registers the table as open. The user may press a button to register the table as his. Potential problem may arise such as other user not using the app and sitting on the sit before the registered user is there. To overcome this potential problem, allow something such as an MRT system. Only registered user can tap on the system and enter the food court.

2) Making a sensor for the disabled people. For example, blind person has a need to travel around using the walking cane. When the sensor is clipped on the shirt of the blind people, the sensor will vibrate when the person is about to walk into a wall. Problems that may encounter : Sensor unable to detect the wall and unable to scan the distance in front of the blind person.

3) Keeping in the clothes when there is a rain. Every time when there's an incoming rain, everyone will rush to keep their clothes so as to prevent their clothes from being drenched. The app is connected with a gadget that keeps the clothings in or out. The owner can choose to activate the app settings to keep the clothes in or out. There will be another automatic settings in which the app reads the current weather report and decide whether to keep the clothes in or out.
